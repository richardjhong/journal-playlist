# Journal Playlist

## Description
User is able to type into the journal and fetch playlists appropriately from the perceived strongest emotion of the text content.

## Technologies
This project uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for the frontend framework and [moment](https://momentjs.com/) for checking time date formating. It also uses three APIs from RapidAPI hub, the [Emotion Analysis API](https://rapidapi.com/twinword/api/emotion-analysis/), the [Famous Quotes API](https://rapidapi.com/saicoder/api/famous-quotes4/) and [Spotify API](https://rapidapi.com/Glavier/api/spotify23/) throughout the app. Lastly [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) was used to create the doughnut chart displaying compilation of emotions over the day.


## Architecture

For the skeleton loading animation when a playlist is being fetched, heavy inspiration was taken from this [link](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/adding-skeleton-loading-animation-with-css-e6833f6e1d0a).
